# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization
- The map is created by using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
- Data markers are used to reflect the magnitude and depth of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and the color spectrum started from green to red, wich means when depth increases the color goes from green to red.
- Popups included to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. Legend added to provide context of the map data.

### Level 2: More Data

Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>. 
In this step I did the following:
* Ploted a second data set on the map.
* Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
* Added layer controls to our map.
